# Configuration

`~/.config/herdr-slack/config.toml` (or the directory `HERDR_SLACK_CONFIG_DIR`

## Options in detail

### [slack.<name>] — several bots

One daemon can run several Slack apps: give each its own section, named.

```toml
[slack.shaka]
bot_token = "xoxb-…"
app_token = "xapp-…"
allowed_user_ids = ["UHXM7NPPW"]
default_pane = "server-local"
channel_pane = "fresh"
spawn_agent = "claude"
role = "You answer questions, plan and review. You do not write code yourself: coding goes to lilith, with a clear brief, and you review the result."

[slack.lilith]
bot_token = "xoxb-…"
app_token = "xapp-…"
allowed_user_ids = ["UHXM7NPPW"]
spawn_agent = "codex"
spawn_args = ["--yolo"]
role = "You implement what shaka briefs, in the project you were opened in, and report back to shaka when done."
```

Each bot keeps its own bindings, and a channel thread can hold one binding
per bot; a message there is for whichever bot it names. The name is also how
the bots address each other — a line of Shaka's
answer that starts with `@lilith` goes to Lilith's pane — and the name of a
bare `[slack]` is `default`. See [the commands guide](./commands.md#two-bots-in-one-thread)
for how a handoff works and what `!spawn` does with `spawn_agent` and
`spawn_args`.

Bindings saved by a single-bot install belong to the first section on
upgrade.

### default_pane

The pane a bot binds a thread to on its own, when spoken to in a thread it
has no binding for — a new DM thread, a mention in a channel. That binding
is silent: only the answer appears. Without a default such a thread is told
to `!bind` first. The pane can then move the thread
itself: see [moving a thread](./commands.md#a-pane-that-moves-its-own-thread).

### role

A sentence or two on what the bot is for, carried to its pane with the first
prompt of every thread, next to the bridge note. The note says what a bot
*can* do — hand work to another, move a thread; the role says what it
*should*. Without it a capable agent does the work itself, which is what
agents do; with "coding goes to lilith" the planner hands over. Each bot's
role is also shown to the others, so a planner knows what the coder is for.

### channel_pane

One pane shared by every thread is one context shared by every thread: two
threads asking at once land in one turn, and each thread's agent remembers
the other's conversation. `channel_pane = "fresh"` gives every channel
thread a pane of its own instead — opened when the thread first speaks to
the bot (the bot's `spawn_agent`, in `spawn_cwd`), bound silently, labelled
after the question. The DM keeps using `default_pane`: one person, one
conversation at a time.

Such panes are closed after `idle_close_minutes` without a message (never
while working). Mentioning the bot in that thread again opens a fresh one,
and it starts with the thread's history, so nothing said there is lost —
only the agent's scratch memory, which is the point.

### relay_terminal_turns

Whether a turn that started **in the pane itself** is delivered to the
thread. Default: `true`.

With this on, every bound pane is polled for herdr's `agent_status`. A pane
that goes from anything else to `working` has started a turn, and the bridge
attaches its ordinary observe loop — without sending any input, because the
prompt has already been submitted. The question is quoted ("⌨️ Asked in the
terminal: …"), then the same one formatted answer per turn as always.

Set it to `false` to keep the terminal private: only questions asked from
Slack — and handoffs between bots — are answered there. It is one setting for
the whole daemon, not per bot. `HERDR_SLACK_RELAY_TERMINAL_TURNS=false`
overrides the file.

### max_total_wait_s

Ceiling on a single observe loop, in seconds. Default: `1800` (30 minutes).

It exists because the idle gate cannot close while herdr reports the pane
working, so without a ceiling a loop has no guaranteed end. It is **not** a
limit on how long an agent may take: when the ceiling expires and herdr still
says the pane is working, the turn continues under a fresh loop and nothing is
reported. The `typing…` indicator runs off herdr's status, so it stays on
across that seam.

The trade-off is deliberate. A pane whose status is stuck at `working` will be
watched indefinitely rather than given up on — visibly, because the indicator
keeps running, and `/stop` ends it.

### progress_interval_ms

Controls how often the shared turn coordinator asks the selected agent wrapper for its status. Default: `15000` (15 seconds). Under `output_mode = "stream"` each poll with no new output also sends one neutral `⏳ Working` message; under the default `"final"` the poll is silent.

This applies equally to Codex JSONL, Pi/OMP JSONL, and screen-scraped agents. Lower values give more frequent updates but can clutter the chat.

### stability_window_ms

For the screen-scrape fallback (such as OpenCode), this is the minimum time in milliseconds the pane must remain unchanged before the turn coordinator considers the response final. Default: `30000` (30 seconds).

Independent from `progress_interval_ms` so you can tune polling cadence and stability window separately. Increase if herdr reports `idle` while the agent is still streaming a long tool's output and you see truncated responses; decrease for snappier handoffs when your agent is well-behaved. Has no effect on Codex/Pi/OMP (those use session logs).

## Environment variables

| Variable | Overrides config.toml |
|---|---|
| `HERDR_SLACK_BOT_TOKEN` | `[slack] bot_token` |
| `HERDR_SLACK_APP_TOKEN` | `[slack] app_token` |
| `HERDR_SLACK_ALLOWED_USER_IDS` | `[slack] allowed_user_ids` |
| `HERDR_SLACK_OUTPUT_MODE` | `output_mode` |
| `HERDR_SLACK_RELAY_TERMINAL_TURNS` | `relay_terminal_turns` |
| `HERDR_SLACK_CONFIG_DIR` | directory holding config.toml |
| `HERDR_SLACK_STATE_DIR` | directory holding state.json |

The token variables address the first bot in the file.
