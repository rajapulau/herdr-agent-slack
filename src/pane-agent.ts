/**
 * PaneAgent — Task 4 of the PaneAgent refactor.
 *
 * One PaneAgent per Herdr pane. Owns:
 *   - exactly one AgentCommunicator (read + write side of the pane),
 *   - at most one ObserveLoopController (the polling loop that emits
 *     `working` / `delta` / `final` events to the daemon).
 *
 * The public surface maps directly to Telegram intents:
 *
 *   - handleMessage  → "user sent text in a bound topic"
 *   - noteExternalTurn → "somebody typed in the pane itself"
 *   - enableFollow   → "/follow [minutes]"
 *   - disableFollow  → "/unfollow"
 *   - stop           → "/stop"
 *   - getLastOutput  → raw pane snapshot (must not consume diff state)
 *   - getLastAnswer  → "/last"  (the answer, cut out of that snapshot)
 *   - dispose        → daemon shutdown
 *
 * Single-loop invariant
 * ---------------------
 * `this.loop` holds the active controller or null. Every entry point
 * (handleMessage / enableFollow) consults it before deciding whether
 * to start a new controller or mutate the existing one. The controller
 * is auto-cleared (set back to null) on its `done` promise resolution,
 * so a fresh message after a finalised turn starts a brand-new
 * controller — exactly the behaviour we want for /last + new-message
 * sequences.
 *
 * Stop-condition wiring
 * ---------------------
 * The daemon's intent flows through the ObserveLoopController's two
 * gates (deadline + waitUntilIdle) via these calls:
 *
 *   - `handleMessage`:  start loop with deadline=null, markUserInput.
 *                       (Existing loop: markUserInput; deadline untouched.)
 *   - `enableFollow`:   start loop with deadline=now+ms, NO markUserInput.
 *                       (Existing loop: updateDeadline(deadline).)
 *   - `disableFollow`:  updateDeadline(null). waitUntilIdle is preserved
 *                       so the loop's stop formula collapses naturally:
 *                         - follow-only then /unfollow: deadline=null +
 *                           waitUntilIdle=false → stop immediately.
 *                         - message then /unfollow:    deadline=null +
 *                           waitUntilIdle=true  → stop on idle.
 *
 * Telegram-agnostic
 * -----------------
 * PaneAgent never imports Telegram types or the grammy client. All
 * output flows through `emit(OutputEvent)`; the daemon receives these
 * and decides how to format / send them. This keeps the unit-testable
 * surface free of network dependencies.
