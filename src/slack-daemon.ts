/**
 * The Slack bridge: threads on one side, herdr panes on the other, and the
 * turn machinery — `PaneAgent`, the observe loop, the pane readers — between
 * them. The app cannot open a thread; a person does, or a message starts one
 * under itself, and the bridge binds it to a pane.
 *
 * A thread is addressed by `channel:thread_ts`. The address works the same
 * for a thread in the app's DM and for one in a channel: a mention of the app
 * in a channel opens the latter, and `!bind` there binds it like any other.
 * In a channel every message for the bridge names its bot — the rest is
 * people talking; in the DM everything is for the bot, and `# ` marks an
 * aside.
 *
 * One daemon can drive several bots (`[slack.shaka]`, `[slack.lilith]`), each
 * with its own Socket Mode connection and its own bindings. In a channel
 * thread they can share the conversation: a line of one bot's answer that
 * starts with `@lilith` is handed to Lilith's pane, so a planner can brief a
 * coder in the open, and `@lilith !spawn` has the bridge open the coder's
 * pane first. The bridge routes text; it never reads it.
