/**
 * Output diff primitives shared between `ObserveLoopController` and
 * the per-pane `AgentCommunicator`.
 *
 * History: these helpers used to live inside `observe-loop.ts`. As of
 * Task 2 of the PaneAgent refactor, the diff state moves into
 * `AgentCommunicator` (so polling loops can read it and `/last` can
 * avoid consuming it). To avoid a circular dep between the loop and
 * the communicator, the pure helpers are extracted here.
 *
 * Behavioural contract:
 *
 *   - `tailOf(s, n)` returns the trailing `n` characters of `s`, or
 *     the whole string when `s` is shorter than `n`.
 *   - `SENT_TAIL_MAX` is the overlap-anchor window the loop remembers
 *     for already-delivered content. Larger values are robust to long
 *     "Working" runs but cost memory.
 *   - `deriveUnseen(snapshot, sentTail)` returns the portion of the
 *     snapshot the user has not seen yet:
 *       1. exact tail match via `lastIndexOf`,
 *       2. window-slide fallback when sentTail was dropped off the
 *          head of a rolling snapshot,
 *       3. no anchor — return "". Emitting a placeholder here would
 *          duplicate already-delivered content.
 *   - `chunkForTelegram(unseen, workingSuffix)` splits the unseen
 *     payload into Telegram-friendly chunks whose TOTAL size
 *     (with the `workingSuffix` appended) is bounded by
 *     `MAX_CHUNK_TOTAL`.
 *
 * None of these helpers throw. They are pure and source-agnostic.

/**
 * Derive the portion of `snapshot` the user has not seen yet, anchored
 * against the last `sentTail` chars we delivered.
 *
 *   1. Exact match: lastIndexOf(sentTail) — everything after the match
 *      is new. Handles the common "agent appended content" case.
 *   2. Window-slide fallback: when the structured source's rolling
 *      window dropped the head, sentTail is not fully present.
 *      We find the largest k such that the new snapshot starts with
 *      sentTail's last k chars and emit everything after.
 *   3. No anchor — return "". This is deliberate: emitting a
 *      `(pane scrolled)` marker would duplicate already-sent content.
 *
 * Trailing-newline note: ScrapeReader applies `stripStatusBar`, which
 * can drop the single trailing `\n` off a snapshot. The chunk we emit
 * carries no leading `\n` (we strip those), so the trailing-newline
 * mismatch is harmless — we just compare a snapshot whose final char is
 * `\n` against a sentTail whose final char may be non-`\n` (or vice-
 * versa) and rely on substring semantics. A real `\n` at position 17
 * inside the snapshot still anchors overlap just fine.
