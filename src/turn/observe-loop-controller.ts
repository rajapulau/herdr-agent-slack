/**
 * ObserveLoopController — Task 3 of the PaneAgent refactor.
 *
 * Replaces the ad-hoc observe-loop function with a stateful controller
 * that:
 *
 *   - owns ONE observe loop per pane (at most one active),
 *   - reads unseen output via AgentCommunicator.getNewOutput() (NOT its
 *     own diff state — the communicator owns `sentTail`),
 *   - chunks unseen content into delta events via chunkForTelegram,
 *   - emits bare `working` ticks when the pane is unchanged, on the
 *     cadence supplied by `progressIntervalMs`,
 *   - evaluates the stop condition via `shouldStop(state)` from
 *     ./stop-condition.ts,
 *   - emits a single `final` event on stop, whose payload depends on
 *     `finalPayload`: "last-delta" (default) prefers the most recent
 *     emitted delta, "full-turn" carries everything observed during the
 *     turn. Either way it falls back to communicator.getLatestOutput()
 *     (truncated to MAX_CHUNK_TOTAL) when nothing was observed.
 *
 * The controller is TELEGRAM-AGNOSTIC: it never speaks to Telegram. The
 * daemon receives OutputEvents and decides how to format / send them.
 *
 * Event types:
 *
 *   { type: "working"; text: string }
 *     — bare heartbeat; emitted only on iterations where no unseen
 *       content was observed. NEVER co-emitted with a delta event in
 *       the same iteration (chunks carry their own working-suffix when
 *       formatWorkingSuffix returns non-empty).
 *
 *   { type: "delta"; text: string }
 *     — one chunk of unseen content, possibly including a working
 *       suffix injected by formatDelta. Multiple deltas may fire in
 *       one iteration when chunkForTelegram splits unseen > MAX_CHUNK_TOTAL.
 *
 *   { type: "final"; text; reason: "idle"|"deadline"|"ceiling"|"aborted"; source }
 *     — terminal event. The loop never emits more events after this.
 *       `source` says whether the payload is accumulated delta output or a
 *       whole-pane snapshot readback.
 *
 * Lifecycle:
 *
 *   const c = new ObserveLoopController(deps);
 *   c.updateDeadline(nowMs);     // optional — set before/after start
 *   c.markUserInput();           // optional — enables waitUntilIdle gate
 *   const done = c.start();      // kick off the polling loop
 *   c.abort("aborted");          // request graceful stop; final fires
 *   await done;                  // (or await c.done)
