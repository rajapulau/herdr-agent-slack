/**
 * Stop-condition model for a single observe-loop turn.
 *
 * A turn is bounded by TWO independent gates that combine into one
 * boolean:
 *
 *   - a deadline (an absolute epoch-ms timestamp, or `null` meaning
 *     "always reached" — used for message-only turns whose real bound
 *     is "agent finished");
 *   - an optional "wait until idle" gate that further requires the pane
 *     to have been stable for `stabilityMs` since `lastChangeAt`.
 *
 * The combined formula is:
 *
 *   stop  <=>  deadline_reached  AND  ( NOT wait_until_idle  OR  is_idle )
 *
 * Why this shape:
 *   - "message only" → deadline=null (always reached) and waitUntilIdle=true:
 *     stop iff is_idle. Pure idle-based termination.
 *   - "follow only" → deadline set, waitUntilIdle=false:
 *     stop iff deadline reached. Idleness is ignored, the timer wins.
 *   - "follow + message" → deadline set, waitUntilIdle=true:
 *     stop iff deadline reached AND idle. The timer cannot fire on a
 *     busy agent; the agent cannot finish early once the timer is armed.
 *   - "/follow 0" → deadline=now, waitUntilIdle=false:
 *     stop is immediately true (the user said "fire when I say so").
 *
 * `lastChangeAt` is owned by the caller (the observe loop), which bumps
 * it whenever it observes a byte-level change in the pane snapshot.
