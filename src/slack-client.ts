/**
 * Slack transport.
 *
 * Two things shape this file:
 *
 *   - **Socket Mode.** The daemon opens an outbound WebSocket instead of
 *     exposing an endpoint, so it runs on a laptop or a box behind NAT with no
 *     tunnel. That needs an app-level token (`xapp-`) as well as the bot token.
 *   - **The assistant container.** Threads are opened by the user, never by
 *     the app, so this client has no "create a place to talk" call.
 *
 * Two kinds of thread reach the bridge, and both are addressed the same way
 * (`channel` + `thread_ts`):
 *
 *   - a thread in the app's DM (the assistant container), delivered by Bolt's
 *     `Assistant` middleware — or a message typed into the DM itself, which
 *     starts a thread under itself;
 *   - a thread in a channel the app is a member of. A message that names the
 *     app is for it — outside a thread it starts one under itself, inside a
 *     thread it joins that thread — and the mention is the address, not part
 *     of the prompt. A message that names nobody is people talking: the app
 *     sees every message in every channel it belongs to, and answering what
 *     was not said to it would be noise.
